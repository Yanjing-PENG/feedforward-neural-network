# feedforward-neural-network
A brief feedforward neural network built manually using Stochastic Gradient Descent method and Backward Propagation algorithm. 

## Introduction
This program builds a two-layer neural network for the Iris dataset.
The first layer is a relu layer with 10 units, and the second one is 
a softmax layer. The network structure is specified in the "train" function.

## Execution
- python fnn.py (python 3.0 or above)
- numpy
